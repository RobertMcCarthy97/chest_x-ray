</p>

In this project deep CNNs are trained to detect pneumonia in chest x-rays.

The project report can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertMcCarthy97/chest_x-ray/blob/main/COMP47650%20Deep%20Learning%20Project:%20Pneumonia%20Chest%20X-Ray%20Classification.pdf).

### Notebooks

There are two jupyter notebooks provided:

`reproduce_results.ipynb`:

- Run this notebook to reproduce the results of the report
by retraining then evaluating a model.
	
`evaluate_trained_models.ipynb`:

- Run this notebook to evaluate the trained models
detailed in the report.
WARNING: models have not been saved to github repo due to file size restrictions, contact for access.
	
Further details can be found in the individual notebooks.
